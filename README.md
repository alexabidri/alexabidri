### Hello, world! 🌟 👋

I'm a seasoned Tech Lead and Engineering Manager with a decade of experience navigating the dynamic landscapes of ride-hailing, productivity tools, SaaS, and healthcare. My journey in tech has been a thrilling ride, filled with innovation and a relentless pursuit of excellence.

At my core, I'm a passionate software developer with a heart for creating user-centric features that truly make a difference. I believe in building solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also delight users and enhance their experiences.
With a strong background in collaborating with diverse teams from various cultural backgrounds, I've had the privilege of working in Paris and Hong Kong, leading remote teams from India, Taiwan, and Malaysia. This global experience has helped me create inclusive teams where everyone feels valued and can do their best work.
